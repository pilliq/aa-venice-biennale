It was a public parkland sacrificed to the international visitors \u00d0 one of the many places in Venice that has succumbed to global tourism. Since the 20th century, following the mass tourism from the rest world, domestic life for local Venetians has undergone drastic changes. Urban spaces of Venice are harshly divided for either the locals or the tourists \u00d0 just like the overcrowded San Marco square is split from private green spaces totally concealed from the public view. The battle of urban spaces was triggered by the division: tourist seeking to explore the true Venetian life by creeping into domestic living spaces, and locals who can\u00d5t afford high rental rates breaks into holiday homes for places to sleep. \n\nWhen increasing numbers of Venetians have fled from the island, more and more tourists are desperately seeking for the architectural shell that seems to host \u00d4true\u00d5 Venetian lifestyle. One would question whether the Venetian locality still exist or it has been drastically transformed. Maybe the urgency is no longer about concentrating on the battle between the locals and the tourist, but on how the city adapts itself to its new inheritors at different times of the year. The new inhabitants of Venice \u00d0 university students, work commuters, migrants, second home owners or even the excursionist \u00d0 could be considered as having already formed a new locality for Venice. One would wonder how a city like Venice, that has been planned to serve the tourist, would start to erase the dated split between the local and the tourist. \n\nThe wall of the Giardini was initially built to protect integrity of the public park land from its industrial neighbourhood. It was then inherited by the Biennale Institution, to protect the densely curated monopoly of international art exhibition site from the local Venetian neighbourhood. However, the arrival of new inhabitants introduced Biennale apartments and holiday homes \u00d0 which are facilities and necessities created by the Biennale. Programmatically, they no longer need separation. Therefore, one would question how Biennale and its site could start being open to the new inhabitants of Venice.\n\nThe project unfolds at the wall, introducing a zone of emerged urban experience. \nInstrumental objects are attached to the wall, penetrating the existing building to generate connective spaces. The division of public and private spaces are reorganised by the hidden spaces, and spatial experiences stitch domestic corridors to pubic calles, exhibition halls with private courtyards. The new corridors introduce difference in the Biennale at different seasons. During the high season, the Biennale\u00d5s apartments offer convenience for visitors to have immerse experience to visit the garden, and during winter time, the Giardini\u00d5s facility would offer classrooms and little theatres and playground for the neighbouring community. Such interaction would introduce a new urban atmosphere for the temporary and permanent inhabitants of Venice. \n", "main_image": "./data/04-MainImage_Yuwei.jpg", "extra_images": ["./data/04-Image_Yuwei_04.JPG", "./data/04-Image_Yuwei_02.jpg", "./data/04-Image_Yuwei_03.jpg", "./data/04-Image_Yuwei_01.jpg"], "prototype_images": ["./data/04-Prototye-Yuwei.jpg"]}, {"id": "10", "name": "May", "description": "\n\nThe Giardini della Biennale is recognised as one of the most prestigious cultural events in the world, becoming a place where time and space is suspended.\n\nPerhaps originating from the absence of African countries in the role of world\u00d5s decision, political or economic influence; most of the continent\u00d5s art and architecture tends to be invisible and absent from the debates in Venice.

A sequence of specified investigations first take place (research on the institution of the biennale, mapping of the site in the Giardini della Biennale in Venice, spatial prototyping exercises on \u00d2porosity\u00d3), generating a context that frames the project as it develops. \n\nEach existing exhibition pavilion is presently discrete and disconnected, both in relation to their surrounding context as well as in relation to each other. They are truly object-like. Yet this object-oriented ontology is not specific to the Giardini, and not specific to the scale of the pavilion. Rather, it is a paradigm that is seemingly pervasive throughout contemporary architectural practice. Cities and urban areas are conceived of as assemblages of discrete buildings (each with their own distinct programme), and buildings in turn are conceived of as assemblages of discrete parts (each with their own distinct function). \n\nIf we draw a line between the ideology of a programme, and the tectonics of how that programme is expressed in space, then one can begin to problematize the intent of the biennale in vis-\u0088-vis the spatial organization of its site in the Giardini. If the putative framework of the biennale is to be a progenitor of an investigative discourse between the participating artists/architects, one where ideas are exchanged freely and debated vigorously in an environment that is connected and borderless, how is this manifested in a Giardini that is understood merely as an aggregation of 30 discrete and autonomous pavilions?\n\nThe project considers the possibility of conceiving the Giardini in an entirely different way. Instead of a collection of individual pavilions, the project thinks of the Giardini as a singular smooth space, where gradual changes in densities, intensities, tensions and contours, inform the notion of what it means to be somewhere in space, rather than the conventional pre-conceived ideas of boundaries and \u00d2buildings\u00d3. \n\nThis is done through an incremental shattering of the existing pavilions, and the introduction of a field of new elements, that exist in a continuity with each other. The fragmentation of the pavilions subvert the neat delimitation of their individual wholes, creating ambiguous zones of overlap that are shared between one pavilion and its neighbour. Implicitly, these new tectonics prompt us to consider what new forms of exhibiting may take place in such interstitial spaces. \n", "main_image": "./data/07-Main Image_Allister.png", "extra_images": ["./data/07-TERM 2 presentation_Page_18.png", "./data/07-TERM 2 presentation_Page_23.png", "./data/07-TERM 2 presentation_Page_21.png", "./data/07-TERM 2 presentation_Page_20.png", "./data/07-TERM 2 presentation_Page_07.png", "./data/07-TERM 2 presentation_Page_17.png", "./data/07-TERM 2 presentation_Page_15.png"], "prototype_images": ["./data/07-Allister.jpg"]}, {"id": "02", "name": "Anna", "description": "The main focus of the project is to create a new way of living and producing that was influenced by the urban fabric.

The perimeter was defined from without through constantly changing urban and natural adjacencies. It hosted the first incarnation of the Biennale in 1894 but it was during the 1930s that a shift occurred. La Biennale gained traction as an institution and began to densify pockets of the public gardens until it held a monopoly over the now, renamed, Giardini della Biennale. This model remains largely unchanged today, the interior is relentlessly curated through a nationalized worldview whilst simultaneously perpetuating the unregulated and obsolete method of sustaining the physical boundary between it and the city of Venice.\nThe project questions the relevance of nation-based spatial organisation at a time when the Biennale and other institutions must acknowledge their shortcomings if they are to remain relevant. A space is proposed for those social groups and minorities unrepresented by a nation-based agenda \u00d0 a refuge for the noncompliant bodies of the Biennale. Scans serve as an archaeological record, identify points of obsolescence and locating new thresholds along the perimeter.

The use is derived from the potential of the new spatial sequence, intentionally nonexplicit and therefore not limited to a single programme.
